# As much as I'd love to keep bindata out of git since it's a generated file,
# if we want "go get" to just work for people, we need to check it in, which
# sadly means anytime the data/* files are modified and it gets regenerated
# by our build script the corresponding changes to this file will have to be
# checked in as well.
